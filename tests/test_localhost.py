"""The loopback check the HTTP transport refuses rebound requests with.

The guard is exercised over a real socket in `test_mcp.py` -- that is where it
is proved to actually refuse. This file is the parsing, which is where the bugs
were.

`plainsong_mcp/localhost.py` is now a re-export of `plainsong.runtime.localhost`,
so every test below exercises the compiler's implementation, not a copy of it --
which is correct: the parsing behaviour still needs to be pinned down from this
side, since `server.py` and everything else in this package reaches it through
`plainsong_mcp.localhost` and would not notice if the re-export pointed at the
wrong thing. `test_this_copy_is_genuinely_the_compilers`, in `TestThereIsOneCopy`
below, is the one test that is new: it replaces a skip branch that used to
cover an installed `plainsong` too old to carry the module, which cannot happen
now that the floor in `pyproject.toml` is 1.4.0.
