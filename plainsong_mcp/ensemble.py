"""Many hands on one score.

A session is a directory. Each contributor owns one voice and writes only its
own part; the parts are merged into a score whenever anyone asks for it. That
is the whole design, and it is what makes several agents working at once mostly
uneventful: they write disjoint files, so there is nothing to merge line by
line.

    <workspace>/ensemble/<name>/
        manifest.json      the header, the form, the voices and the version
        parts/<voice>.song one file per voice, written by its owner
        score.song         the merged result -- generated, never hand-edited
        log.jsonl          one line per accepted change, oldest first

Concurrency
-----------
The session carries a version that increases by one on every accepted write. A
write states the version it was made against; it is refused if *that voice* has
changed since. Writing to another voice moves the session version but cannot
invalidate your work, so two agents on two voices both succeed, and two agents
on one voice from the same base end with one winner and one rebase. Ownership
is the softer half of the same idea: claiming a voice stops two agents choosing
the same one in the first place, while the version check is what actually keeps
the file honest.

No lock is held while an agent is thinking. The lock here is taken to swap a
file and dropped microseconds later, because a model call takes seconds and a
lock that spans one is a lock that will be found abandoned.
