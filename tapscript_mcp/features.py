"""Sixteen numbers per bar.

A model that has to react to music needs a fixed-width view of it. This turns
an :class:`~tapscript.notation.ir.Arrangement` into one vector per bar, in the
order :data:`FEATURE_NAMES`, each value in roughly ``[0, 1]`` (``contour``
alone is signed). The layout is the one the fleet-jepa bandleader consumes, so
a written score and a recorded performance can be described the same way, and
the notation in this repository becomes a corpus a model can be trained on.

Analysis only: no rendering, no dependencies, and no state. Raw quantities --
onsets per beat, semitones, MIDI velocities -- are divided by the references in
:data:`REFERENCES` and clipped, so a value of 1.0 means "at or past the
reference" rather than "the largest seen in this piece". Normalising against
the piece itself would make a bar's numbers depend on the bars around it, and
two agents analysing different excerpts would disagree about the same bar.
