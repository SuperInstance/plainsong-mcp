"""Checks that ``specs/mcp.toml`` points at.

Each function returns ``(ok, detail)``, runs without network access, without
optional dependencies, and writes only inside a temporary directory. They are
the executable half of the spec: a user runs them to find out whether this
install can serve MCP, and the build agent runs them after a change.

They live here rather than in ``tapscript/selfcheck.py`` so that deleting
``mcp/`` takes its checks with it.
