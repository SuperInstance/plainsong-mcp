"""The tools this server adds to the registry.

The MCP server does not keep a list of tools of its own: it enumerates
``ToolRegistry.specs()``, so a tool added anywhere else in the codebase appears
over the protocol without anything here changing. What this module does is add
the ones that only make sense over a protocol -- the ensemble session, feature
extraction, and the bridge to the conductor -- in the same shape as every other
tool, so the CLI agent gets them too.

Tools return a value, never an exception. A failure is something the model has
to read and act on; an exception would end its turn instead.
